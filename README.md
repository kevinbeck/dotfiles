Kevin Colyar's Dot Files
------------------------

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


Installation
============

```sh
    git clone git://github.com/kevincolyar/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install
```


Environment
===========

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash 
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command.

```sh
    chsh -s /bin/zsh
```


Download
===========
```sh

  curl -L https://github.com/kevincolyar/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar zx

```
